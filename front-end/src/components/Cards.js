      <h1 className="about-h1">Lamp Educational and Charitable Trust is a non-profit organization started in 2010 by Jaganathan Rajagopal in Bangalore.

When he was working in a corporate company, often he was visiting NGOs, Old Age Homes, Cancer Hospitals, and Government Schools in Bangalore as part of CSR activities, after listening to many students’ painful stories, he volunteered to donate part of his salary and also collected donations from his friends to pay fees to the school and college dropout students. Later we started donating textbooks, notebooks, stationaries, uniforms, new & old dresses, and ration kits.</h1>
